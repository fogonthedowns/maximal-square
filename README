Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

Example:

Input: 

1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0

Output: 4

Solution: Dynamic Programming
Formula: dp(i,j)=min(dp(i−1,j),dp(i−1,j−1),dp(i,j−1))+1
         max: max(maxsqlen, dp[i][j])
         return max * max
Time Space complexity: O ( m n ) O(mn)
